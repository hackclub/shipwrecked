### If they are requesting a letter of invitation:

1. Check if they have >30 hours of logged time on hackatime
2. Verify their projects going towards that time are flagged as shipped (from previous reviews)
   - If they do not meet this requirement, send that as feedback & do not continue
3. Talk to Deven & let him know their name and that they are all good to receive a letter

### General guidelines
- If you are not 100% sure when dealing with this, please don't review it or ask in the review channel.
- If they are asking a question about the event or the bay, that is not review. Redirect them to [#shipwrecked-help](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08KS9QGYRY) on slack
- Try to figure out which of the current review models their review request fits in (Ship/Ship update/Viral review)
- Ask in the review channel if you can't figure it out or leave it for an organizer to review
