## Ship Update Review Runbook

### Definitions:

- **Shipped Project:** A project that is code-complete, published on source control (e.g., GitHub), and easily experienceable (live website or clear local setup instructions taking \<2 minutes). It should be polished, with a descriptive README and minimal bugs/visual glitches.

### Review Process:

1.  **Verify Feature Updates:**
    - Assess if reported feature updates since the last submission are realistic given the Hackatime hours.
2.  **Confirm "Shipped" Status:**
    - Ensure the project still meets all requirements for a "Shipped Project" (see definition above), as projects can change between iterations.
3.  **Commit Check (Since Last Submission):**
    - Verify approximately one commit per hour for the work done since the last ship review submission.
    - Focus on commits made after the previous submission.
    - Sample random commits and optionally skim others.
4.  **Decision Making:**
    - Assume good faith by default.
    - If rejecting, provide actionable feedback for resubmission.
    - If unsure, approve the project.
