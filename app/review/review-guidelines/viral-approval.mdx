# Viral approval

## General guidelines:
- The post must reference their project in some way.
- The goal of the post should appear to be in some way promoting their project
- They must be promoting the project that they are submitting for review (check project name & repo to get in idea of what their project is to verify this)
- If doing cumulatively from multiple posts, the number of posts must be reasonable. (ex. 30 posts getting you to 10k views is not reasonable, 5-10 is reasonable)

## Platform specific notes:
- Hacker news: They should be linking a web.archive.org link to hacker news that shows their post about their project on the front page.
