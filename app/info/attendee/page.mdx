## Travel Accommodations
We will be hosting people arriving early and leaving later at [HI Boston Hostel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MWN4jDQeK6HmAP8S8) near the Boston Common. The address is 19 Stuart St, Boston, MA 02116\. Attendees will be in private rooms with only other attendees and will be supervised by Hack Club staff throughout their stay.

## Island Rooming Situation
You will be staying in dorms with 1-3 roommates. The dormitories are hall-style buildings with individual rooms connected by a hallway. The buildings are not air-conditioned, but each room has a ceiling fan. You are welcome to bring guests into your room as long as your roommates are okay with it. Each dorm also has a lounge on the first floor where you can hang out and work.

Floors will have assigned genders, as each floor shares a single, communal bathroom. Showers will be in the communal bathrooms. You are free to use the bathroom and shower any time you want, but remember that you will be sharing the space with all your fellow hackers on the floor.

Roommates will be assigned by organizers, but you will get to input preferences and roommate requests in the roommate form. Your roommates and teammates will be independent of each other. If you have any concerns about your roommate before and during the event, don’t hesitate to reach out to an organizer.

## Safety Restrictions
We don’t want to limit your activities on the island, but we must impose some rules for everyone’s overall safety. The island will be dark at night, and it will be hard to see outside. We will impose restrictions on where and when you can be. Our policy will be clarified further during the event, and it is subject to change at the discretion of the organizers depending on the situation.

## Swimming
Swimming will be allowed **only** off the beach area during the designated time, which will be marked on the calendar. You must swim with a buddy and be supervised by an adult Shipwrecked staff member at all times. If you do not know how to swim, you’re also welcome to dip your feet in the water. It is highly recommended to wear swim shoes, as there are many mussel shells along the shoreline. There will not be a lifeguard.

## Food 
We will have 8 meals in the island dining hall, starting from Friday dinner to Monday breakfast. We will try to provide you with a to-go lunch on Monday, but that is still TBD. Because of the number of people, we will have two seatings for each meal. Please make sure you have filled out your dietary restrictions in our form. We will do our best to accommodate any you might have.

## Teams
We will not have a traditional team system. Instead, you will have the opportunity to work with different people throughout the event. More details will be revealed during the event\!
