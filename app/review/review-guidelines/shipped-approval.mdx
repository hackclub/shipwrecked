## Ship Review Runbook

### Definitions:

- **Shipped Project:** A project that is code-complete, published on source control (e.g., GitHub), and easily experienceable (live website or clear local setup instructions taking \<2 minutes). It should be polished, with a descriptive README and minimal bugs/visual glitches.

### Review Process:

1.  **Initial Checks:**
    - Verify project is a "Shipped Project" (see definition above).
    - Assess if reported time is realistic for the project.
    - Confirm approximately one commit per hour (sample random commits and optionally skim others).
2.  **Decision Making:**
    - Assume good faith by default.
    - If rejecting, provide actionable feedback for resubmission.
    - If unsure, approve the project.
