# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked is a once-in-a-lifetime, four-day flagship hackathon on Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor that is organized by Hack Club, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports a global community of over 50,000 high school makers.

## What is Shipwrecked?

On **August 8-11**, you and 130 other hackers will gather on **Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor** for a once in a lifetime, **4-day story-based hackathon**!

As soon as you get there, you will all start working together to survive on the island you've been stranded on.

Once you are on the island, everyone will work in smaller groups and complete quests. These will be centered around interacting with the world around you: helping the island dwellers develop software or hardware projects that help them sell their produce, helping the pirates plan their routes more effectively, or building projects to help your fellow shipwreck-mates organize your efforts more effectively. _(Not literally, of course... There are no pirates or island dwellers in the Boston Harbor. This is similar to Dungeons & Dragons!)_

# The Bay

Through **[The Bay](/info/the-bay)**, you will earn an invitation to Shipwrecked. In The Bay, you will spend **60 hours making 4 projects**, about 15 hours each.

Make something that you're really proud of, and then share it with the world! Once you reach 60 hours by shipping 4 projects, you will receive an invitation to Shipwrecked!

## The Pier

Every week, you can meet up with your friends either in person or over [The Pier](https://pier.hackclub.com) â€” our video game-like digital meeting space to work!
