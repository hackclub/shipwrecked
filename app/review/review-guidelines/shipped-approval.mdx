## Ship Review Runbook

### Definitions:

- **Shipped Project:** A project that is code-complete, published on source control (e.g., GitHub), and easily experienceable (live website or clear local setup instructions taking \<2 minutes). It should be polished, with a descriptive README and minimal bugs/visual glitches.
- **High Quality (Must fit at least 3 of the requirements below):**
    - Feels meaningful in some way
        - https://thesupernile.github.io/Sortolizer/ helped me understand how sorting algorithms work.
    - Well designed, easy to use
        - https://hc-wallpaper-app.vercel.app/ is intuitive, and easy to use.
    - Clean and well thought out
        - https://hc-wallpaper-app.vercel.app/ shows interesting design, that is clearly well thought out.
    - Custom art/hand-made design
        - https://bffwouj3472.itch.io/folding-fury has art made for the project that is well integrated.
    - Novel mechanics
        - https://livingroom.sirbread.dev/ has mechanics (sharing a tv remote live with others on the internet) which I've never seen before.
Overarching, has to be no AI slop for all projects

### Review Process:

1.  **Initial Checks:**
    - Verify project is a "Shipped Project" (see definition above).
    - Verify the project is "High Quality" (see definition above)
    - Assess if reported time is realistic for the project.
    - Confirm approximately one commit per hour (sample random commits and optionally skim others).
2.  **Decision Making:**
    - Assume good faith by default.
    - If rejecting, provide actionable feedback for resubmission.
    - If unsure, approve the project.
