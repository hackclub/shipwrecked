### Letter of Invitation Request:

1.  **Check Hackatime Hours:** Verify the user has >30 logged hours on Hackatime.
2.  **Verify Shipped Projects:** Confirm their projects contributing to those hours are flagged as "shipped" from previous reviews.
    - If not met, provide this feedback and stop.
3.  **Notify Deven:** Inform Deven of the user's name and that they are eligible for a letter.

### General Guidelines:

- **Uncertainty:** If unsure, do not review; ask in the review channel.
- **Non-Review Questions:** If the user asks about the event or The Bay, redirect them to the #shipwrecked-help Slack channel. This is not a review task.
- **Categorize Request:** Determine if the review request fits existing models (Ship, Ship Update, Viral) & give that feedback.
- **Seek Help:** If categorization is unclear, ask in the review channel or leave for an organizer.
