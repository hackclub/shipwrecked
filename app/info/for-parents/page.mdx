# Parent's Guide & FAQ to Shipwrecked:

## What is Hack Club?

Hack Club is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission is to **foster a wholesome generation of coders, makers, founders, and builders**. Hack Club is a network of hundreds of student-led computer science clubs and a safe, positive online community of over 50,000 high school makers from around the world. Hack Club programs are **free and accessible to all students**. We support teenagers in making real projects in the real world. Hack Club is supported by notable figures in the tech industry, including GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner, Dell Founder Michael Dell and executives at Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and GitHub, as well as many up-and-coming tech startups.

## What is Shipwrecked?

Shipwrecked is a **once-in-a-lifetime, four-day hackathon** organized by Hack Clubbers—for Hack Clubbers. It is a themed hackathon where participants are invited to build creative projects inspired by the idea of being shipwrecked—right on the **unique, historic grounds of Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor**.

**Shipwrecked starts on Friday, August 8th at 3:00 pm and ends on Monday, August 11th at 5:00 pm**. This event offers a blend of outdoor adventure and tech creativity in a truly inspiring setting.

_These times (not dates) could change, but they will be thoroughly communicated if so._

## Who can participate?

**Anyone 18 or under at the time of the event and who has completed [The Bay](/info/the-bay) is allowed to participate**.

## What are the costs associated?

**Participation is entirely free,** but there are requirements for entry that your child must meet. Without completing The Bay (our online engineering challenge), your child won't be able to join Shipwrecked. We will cover the entire four-day experience, including meals and activities. Participants are generally responsible for their own travel to Boston, but we are able to offer limited travel stipends (see Travel section for more).

## What can participants expect?

Participants can expect to **build creative projects inspired by the theme of being shipwrecked**. There will be a **variety of workshops and sessions designed for all skill levels as well as some surprises\!** In line with Hack Club tradition, we aim to create an experience that is **wholesome, kind, collaborative, and optimistic**. Similar to other Hack Club events, parents can anticipate their child's **technical aptitude to increase considerably** and that they will likely **end the trip with projects they built**. They will also have the opportunity to **gain friendships and connections with technical people their age**.

## Location, drop-off, and pickup
