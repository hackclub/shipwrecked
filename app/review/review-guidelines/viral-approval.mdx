# Viral Approval Runbook

### Definitions:

- **Viral Project:** A project that meets specific view/engagement thresholds on a social media platform, as detailed at [https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/info/go-viral](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/info/go-viral).

### Review Process:

1.  **Post Content Verification:**
    - Ensure the post references the submitted project.
    - Confirm the post's goal appears to be promoting the project.
    - Verify the post promotes the _correct_ project (check project name and repository).
2.  **Multiple Posts (If Applicable):**
    - If cumulative views/engagement from multiple posts are claimed, ensure the number of posts is reasonable (e.g., 5-10 posts is reasonable; 30 posts is not).
3.  **Platform-Specific Checks:**
    - **Hacker News:** The submission must include a web.archive.org link showing their project post on the Hacker News front page.
4.  **Viral Threshold Confirmation:**
    - Verify the project meets one of the viral thresholds defined at [https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/info/go-viral](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/info/go-viral).
    - Refer to the embedded content for specific thresholds:
