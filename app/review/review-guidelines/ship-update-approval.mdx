## Ship update review guidelines

### To reject or not reject:
- Assume good faith unless seeing evidence otherwise
- When rejecting a project, you must include actionable feedback in order for the user to get their project approved when re-submitting.
- If you're unsure, give them the benefit of the doubt

### Ship update requirements:
- Make sure what they report as feature updates from last time seems realistic given the time hackatime reported
- Make sure their project is still a ship. _(They should already have the required elements for a ship, but nevertheless, you must check anyways as projects tend to change a lot from iteration to iteration)_
- Check they have about 1 commit per hour that seams realistic based on the changes they reported. (you should only check commits since their last submission for ship review)
  - Tip: A good fast way to do this is to sample a few random commits. Optionally, you can skim the other commits.

### Here is what they need in order to hit the shipped requirement:
- Code published on a source control site (ideally github)
- A way you can easily experience it. Either:
  - A live website that is functional
  - Instructions on how to set it up locally that work for you and take a reasonable amount of time (less than 2 minutes is a good rule of thumb when in doubt)
- The project should feel like a finished project this means:
  - There should be a descriptive readme that make you feel like you understand what the project is/does and how you could set it up locally to develop on it
  - There should be relatively few bugs/visual glitches that you notice. 
  - It should feel like a polished project. Make sure to give specific feedback if you reject it for this so they can improve.
